Welcome to <b>WeReader</b>, the website that combines reading with a social space!

The main goal and best possible version of this website should allow a user to sign in with their Google email (through OAuth) and access all their purchased and wish-listed books. The website pulls data from the Google Books API through it's search function, focusing solely on epubs to allow for text altering (*fingers crossed*). These epubs are then put into my backend database of books, collecting the unique google id as well as other vital information (title, author, publish date, genre, etc.). The user can sift and search through the aformentioned database and find books to purchase, sending them to the googlebooks site for security, add to their wish-list for future reading, or leave a review, altering the overall rating on the book to allow for accurate searching.

The algorithmic aspect of this website incorporates multiple methods of personal recommendations! We take the user's personal input of favorite genres, books, and authors to find the best potential matches to their needs. These recommendations are never the same, as they refresh every time the page does, allowing for more options. 

Lastly, the social space behind WeReader encompasses a "Friend" system! The most enjoyable about reading should be how you can share that experience with others, so WeReader allows a user to send a book recommendation directly to a user's email.
